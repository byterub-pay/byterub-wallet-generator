MoneroV offline wallet generator

This page generates a new MoneroV address. You can use it to generate a MoneroV wallet offline.  It is self contained and does all the necessary calculations locally, so is suitable for generating a new wallet on a machine that is not connected to the network, and may even never be. This way, you can create a MoneroV wallet without risking the keys.
